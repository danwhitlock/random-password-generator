**Description**

This is a random password generator I have built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It provides the following functionality -   

- A user is prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters
    - If an incorrect value is chosen, an alert is displayed and the process restarts
- A user is promoted to select whether to include lower case, upper case, numeric and/or special characters in their password.  At least one option must be chosen
    - if no options are chosen, an alert is displayed and the process restarts
- Once length and character types have been selected, a randomised password meeting the chosen criteria is displayed to the user on the page

I have used a combination of functions, loops, methods and if/if else statements in order to implement this logic.
